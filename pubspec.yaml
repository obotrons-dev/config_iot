flutter:
  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/Obt.png
    - images/chirstmas.png
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
#    - family: Raleway
#      fonts:
#        - asset: fonts/Raleway-Regular.ttf
#        - asset: fonts/Raleway-Italic.ttf
#          style: italic
    - family: RobotoMono
      fonts:
        - asset: font/Roboto_Mono/static/RobotoMono-Bold.ttf
        - asset: font/Roboto_Mono/static/RobotoMono-BoldItalic.ttf
          weight: 600
